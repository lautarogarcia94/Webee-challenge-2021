This SpringBoot API is a CRUD to manage Device Entity. Each one have 3 fields:
* date -> format(DDMMYYYY) and it cannot be before 01012020
* MAC address ->  format(FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF)
* ID -> String with 10 lower case letters, autogenerated by the API

While running this Rest API, it connects to FireBase by its own but does not works with GAE.

For registering a device, you should send a POST request to "http://localhost:8080/device-monitoring/register-device" endpoint. The date and MAC 
address of the device that would be registered have to be in the body of the request, for example:
{"date": "21042020","macAddress": "FF:02:FF:00:24:FF"}.


For deleting a registered device, you should send a DELETE request to "http://localhost:8080/device-monitoring/register-device/{ID}" endpoint. The ID is a
String with 10 lower case letters, for example: "qwertyuiop"


To get date from Firebase about registered devices, there are three ways:
1) To get a list of all devices registered, send a  GET request to "http://localhost:8080/device-monitoring/get-devices-list" endpoint.

2) To get a device by looking it for its ID, send a GET request to "http://localhost:8080/device-monitoring/get-device-by-id/{ID}" 
endpoint. The ID is a String with 10 lower case letters, for example: "qwertyuiop"

3) To get a device by looking it for its MAC address, send a GET request to "http://localhost:8080/device-monitoring/get-device-by-mac/{MAC Address}" endpoint.
